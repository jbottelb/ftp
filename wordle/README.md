## Wordle
By Josh and Joe

TODO:
- Do the server and client need seperate readmes?
- select the winner based on score and send that
- Extension 3, however that should be done
- Python client does not exit on its own
- game attributes need to be reset in order to launch a new game
(get the points for the lobby launching twice from one program)

## Known issues
- Clients launched in the same file can have input issues in the Join, not
much of a big deal, just kill the program and move on to Join Instance
